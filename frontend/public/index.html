             Hi, I’m Sergio Serrano Jr, a Business Systems Analyst based in Southern California, Los Angeles County.

            My experience centers around supporting enterprise system migrations and technology transformations. I’ve contributed to initiatives including POS application replacements, workforce management software transitions, MDM implementations, and enhanced network monitoring solutions. Through these projects, I’ve worked closely with business stakeholders and cross-functional IT teams to ensure stable, efficient system rollouts.

            Collaborating with developer and middleware teams gave me valuable insight into backend systems, integrations, and workflows. That exposure sparked a strong interest in DevOps, automation, and system optimization — areas I’m actively exploring and developing.
            </p>
